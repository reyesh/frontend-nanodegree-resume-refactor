# Resume v2.0
This is a complete overhaul of my previous [frontend-nanodegree-resume project](https://github.com/reyesh/frontend-nanodegree-resume). It has been refactored this time separating concerns, Model, View and Octopus, MV* pattern design!

Currently this application is built using the Bootstrap framework, Javascript, JSON, jQuery, Google Maps API, Firebase (hosting the JSON resume object) and hosted on GitHub Pages.

[Current live production version](http://reye.sh/frontend-nanodegree-resume-refactor/) (gh-pages branch)
